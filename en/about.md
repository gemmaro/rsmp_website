# What is RSMP?
Effective and intelligent handling of traffic is a priority to the cities, municipalities and state bodies on the Nordic region.

To achieve this goal, the protocols used to monitor and control traffic signal, variable message signs and other road side equipment are central. Proprietary standards cause vendor lock-in and fragmented infrastructure, while open standard can reduce maintenance costs, increase interoperability and support innovation.

RSMP (Roadside Message Protocol) was developed as an open protocol by the Swedish road authority Trafikverket for this purpose and is used extensively in Sweden. Use is now growing outside Sweden. In Denmark, Copenhagen Aalborg and Kolding municipality have chosen RSMP for communicating with traffic signals and other road side equipment. In Finland, the city of Oulu has required RSMP in traffic signal tenders in recent years.

RSMP is an  open modern and lightweight protocol, based on JSON messages. It can be easily extended via Signal Exchange List, which are maintained for different types of equipments, like traffic signals and variable messages signs.

# The need for Nordic RSMP collaboration
As the use of RSMP grows in the Nordic region, there’s a need for an organisation that can manage the development of the standard, for the benefit of all involved. A closer collaboration will make it possible to pool development resources and share knowledge, and ensure that the protocol doesn’t diverge into smaller national variants.

A strong organisation around RSMP will ensure that the standard can grow into a widely used, flexible and innovative protocol for handling the communication with all types of road side equipment and traffic management systems in the Nordic region.

# Establishing a Nordic RSMP organisation
The Swedish road authority Trafikverket, the Danish road authority Vejdirektoratet, the municipality of Stockholm and the municipality of Copenhagen is working together to establish a Nordic RSMP organisation.

After establishment, we will invite all relevant partners to join the organisation, including industry partners.

The mission of the RSMP organisation will be to develop and promote the RSMP standard.
The organisation will establish procedures for development and validation, and will establish technical roadmaps.

The organisation will also facilitate knowledge sharing, inform and engage new potential partners in the region, as well as provide a Nordic voice in the ongoing EU-standardisation work.

# Supporting EU-standardisation
The EU is currently working on various ITS standards, e.g. in the CEN TC278/WG17 working group. We fully support this work and welcome European standards, as long as they are of high quality and meet the needs of the Nordic region.

European standards will take time to develop and the approach is to provide a graceful transition into the new standards, building on regional standards. We see RSMP as a very good platform for such a graceful transition to new EU-wide future standards.

We will work on establishin RSMP as a regional standard that can be interfaced or replaced with European standards once they are ready.

We will also use the Nordic RSMP organisation to provide a constructive Nordic voice in the ongoing EU standardisation process.
