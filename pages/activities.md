Our mission, activities and organization are defined in the [RSMP Nordic Charter]({% link pages/charter.md %}).

We maintains the RSMP specification and related open-source tools, and facilitate user groups and knowledge sharing related to RSMP.

## User Group
The RSMP Nordic User Group in a network for sharing knowledge about RSMP and its practical use. The user group also provide input to the technical working group.

If you're wondering whether RSMP might be a good fit for your city, need input on how to require RSMP in tenders or want to share experiences about RSMP solutions, we recommend you join upcoming User Group meetings. You're also welcome to suggest themes for upcoming meetings.

Some meetings are only for road authorities, while others are open to anyone interested.

## Working Group
The RSMP Nordic Working Group discusses technical issues and produce proposals for review by the Board. The working group is where we shape the next versions of the RSMP specifications.

Anyone interested can join the RSMP workring group, but only RSMP Nordic partners can be listed as co-authors of proposals.

## Technical Board
The RSMP Nordic Board is responsible for technical coordination and decisions, and maintain the RSMP roadmap. The board reviews technical proposals from the working group and decides which proposals are accepted.

The board has representatives from only public road authorities and is appointed by the board.

## Steering Group

Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland each have permanent seats in the steering group, but can invite  other RSMP Nordic road authority partners to fill remaining seats.
