# RSMP Tools
RSMP Nordic maintains a set of open-source tools for working with RSMP.

This include both GUI and command-line tools for validation and working with RSMP implementations.

## RSMP Simulator
The [RSMP Simulator ](https://rsmp-nordic.github.io/rsmp_validator) is an Windows application written in C#, which can by used for manual testing of RSMP implementations.

## RSMP Validator
The [RSMP Validator](https://rsmp-nordic.github.io/rsmp_validator) is a command-line too based on Ruby and RSpec and can by used for automated testing and validation of RSMP implementations.

## RSMP Building Blocks
We also maintain several Ruby gems (libraries) for working with RSMP.

The RSMP Validator is build on these building blocks, but you can also use them to build new or specialized RSMP tools.

- [RSMP gem](https://github.com/rsmp-nordic/rsmp): Ruby gem for handling RMSP communication.
- [RSMP Schema](https://github.com/rsmp-nordic/rsmp_schema): JSON Schema for automatically validating RSMP messages
- [RSMP Schemer](https://github.com/rsmp-nordic/rsmp_schemer): Ruby gem for validating RSMP messages against the RSMP JSON Schemas.

See all our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/rsmp-nordic).
