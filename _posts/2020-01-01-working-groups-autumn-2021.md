 To work on the next version of the RSMP specification, a series of Working Group meetings have been schedules in the autumn of 2021.

The Working Group Meetings will be held online on September 8th and 22nd, both days from 10-11AM.

Public and private sector partners and stakeholders have been invited to participate and contribute with their needs and wishes for the release of the next RSMP version.

Among the topics to be discussed will be new priority request and monitoring functions.

If you are interested in joining one or more of the Working Group meetings, please contact [Jos van Vlerken](mailto:cz9y@kk.dk) for registration or more information.

As always, you can follow the discussion in [our GitHub repositories](https://github.com/rsmp-nordic). We hope to see you virtually at the Working Group meetings.
