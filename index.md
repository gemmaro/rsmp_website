# An Open Protocol for Roadside Equipment
RSMP is on open, modern, lightweight and flexible protocol for communication between traffic lights, other road side equipment and central monitoring and traffic management systems.

RSMP is maintained by the [RSMP Nordic partnership]({% link pages/organization.md %}) of Nordic road authorities and has no license fees. It's supported by [open-source tools]({% link pages/tools.md %}) for development and validation.

## More Choice
Because RSMP is on open and vendor-neutral protocol, road authortities are free to mix equipment and systems from different suppliers. This can often lead to more efficient and stable system maintenance. For example, a single supervisor system can be used to manange equipment from  different vendors.

## Backed by Nordic Road Authorities
RSMP is maintained and develop by the [RSMP Nordic partnership]({% link pages/organization.md %}) of Nordic road authorities. We strive to meet the need of both small and big road authorities.

RSMP has been proven on street since 2011 by major Nordic players such as the Swedish Transport Administration and the City of Copenhagen. The use of RSMP is growing across the Nordics.

## Supported by the Industry
A growing list of suppliers provide equipment and systems that suport RSMP.

## Participate
The RSMP Nordic partnership is open for anyone interested in RSMP, both road authorities, suppliers and consultants.

We share knowledge and needs in the User Group, and meet in in the Working Group to discuss and develop the next versions of the specifications and tools.

[Participation]({% link pages/join.md %}) in RSMP Nordic is free.

## Supported by EU Interreg
RSMP Nordic has received funding from EU Interreg Øresund-Kattegat-Skagerak.
